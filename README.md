# AHKBiocompareScraper
Extracts data from tables within Biocompare product listings

### Dependencies
Autohotkey v2
(Excel)

Mistakes made when writing this script (I wasn't considering publishing it online, when I wrote it):
1) The output .txt file is not in any standardized format. I'm using the included websearch.xlsm file to sort it into into excel tables. If I'll have the time, I'll rewrite it to output something like JSON.
2) More mistakes were definitely made.
